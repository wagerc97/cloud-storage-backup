-----------------------------------------


This is the installation guide for the CLOUD-STORAGE-BACKUP (CSB) PROJECT. If you're 
reading this, you've probably just installed the project 
on your system and want to install it.

What should I do next?
----------------------

There are a view configurations required to use this installation.
I will explain them in chronological order. 

1.  Ensure the cloud-storage-backup root folder is located in your home directory. 
    This directory is typically called '/home/<username>' and 
    called '~' in short. 
    Other wise download it from GitHub 
    $ git clone https://github.com/wagerc97/cloud-storage-backup.git
    Do not forget to give the downloaded scripts the permission to be executed. 
    (this command will allow execution of all files in the directory recursively)
    $ chmod -R +x ~/cloud-storage-backup/
    
2.  Install rclone on your system (in case you do not have it installed or
    if this project installation does not do it for you automatically)
    I recommend the installation via this repo: https://github.com/pageauc/rclone4pi
    Further information here: https://linuxhint.com/set-up-rclone-raspberry-pi/
    
3.  Configure rclone for your remote storage. This can be done by calling 
    $ rclone config
    in the console and following the commands. 

    === Rclone Configuration ===

    I recommend following these steps closely to avoid future troubles the following parameters 
    during rclone configuration to be able to use most of the default environment variables. 
    Change the environment variables. Only two values necessary by default. The file holding all 
    environment variables is located under '~/cloud-storage-backup/src/config/envconfig.txt'. 
    
    - When asked to enter a name for new remote, you can chose any name you like. Also enter this 
      name in the variable REMOTECONFIG.
    - Then hit Enter until a browser window opens and you can sign in your cloud account.
      You don't have to stay signed in. 
      Wait until the page tells you "Success!". Then go back to the console. 
    - Then you can basically just hit Enter until you are done.
    - Going back to the envconfig.txt file, enter the name of your local storage device 
      in the variable LOCALSTORAGEDEVICENAME.
    - The remote storage will be mounted to '/mnt/pi/cloud' by default. 
      This can be changed if necessary. 

 
5.  Ensure you have the (physical) external storage that you configured in the environment 
    variables plugged in correctly. Also make sure it has enough storage capacity.
    Check that it is compatible with your system (the program checks it as well later). 
    
6.  Installation complete :-)



What do I do if it doesn't work?
--------------------------------

 1. Read the logfiles located under '~/cloud-storage-backup/logs/'. You will most likely be looking in 
    control directory. 
 2. Only after 1. call Clemens Wager or write an Email to wagerc-dev@outlook.com 
    (I may or may not read it)



Logs are your best friend :)
