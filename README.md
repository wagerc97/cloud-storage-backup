# Cloud Storage Backup (CSB)

A set of scripts that use rclone to backup your remote/cloud storage to a local storage device. 
## Details
### Focus on:
- good logging
- easy configuration
- good documentation


### Note: 
I used shell scripts for the first time in a larger project, so I learned a lot along the way. If you encounter any mistakes please let me now ;)
