MANUAL.txt
===================

1) English version
2) Deutsche Version weiter unten 
-----------------------------------------

This is the manual for the RPI SYNC PROJECT. If you're 
reading this, you've probably just installed and configured the project 
on your system. Now you can use the project. 

The backup.sh script uses the 'rclone copy' command, so only new and changed files
and folders will be transferred. Old local files/folder with the same name will be 
overwritten. 


What should I do next?
----------------------

There are a view possibilities:

 - ONDEMAND: use the scripts manually whenever you want to 
 - AUTOMATED: create Cronjobs to run the scripts automatically
 - MAINTENANCE: follow the according steps in INSTALLATION.txt


!!! ATTENTION !!!  !!! ATTENTION !!!  !!! ATTENTION !!!  !!! ATTENTION !!!  !!! ATTENTION !!!

  Do not execute the rpi-sync scripts while other rpi-sync scripts are running. 
  Whether it is because you started them twice or because a cronjob started automatically. 
  The resulting behaviour was not tested and I won't take responsibility for the outcome. 

!!! ATTENTION !!!  !!! ATTENTION !!!  !!! ATTENTION !!!  !!! ATTENTION !!!  !!! ATTENTION !!!



@ONDEMAND:

    Start one of the scripts in '~/rpi-sync/src/scripts/control' which carries out the 
    required procedure. All controlling scripts are well explained inside. 
    (I don't recommend using any of the other scripts by themselves)

@AUTOMATED:

    I recommend using Cronjob, which is available on almost every linux distribution. 
    Simply open the your console and type 
    $ crontab -e
    Then you will be able to define cronjobs there. For further information read up on 
    Cronjobs the internet.
    
@MAINTENANCE:
    
    You can perform system checks to see whether the installation is ready for your next 
    backup process. In this case run '~/rpi-sync/src/scripts/control/system-check-for-backup.sh'
    This will basically execute all scripts except the backup.sh itself.
    

# CAUTION!
Your local storage may run full at some point as all changes will be saved.
Allthough not the complete remote storage directory is saved. 
    
# Notes
 - There is a script that deletes old logfiles (by default the ones older than 30 days).
   You can configure it to run i.e. every Friday at midnight.
    
    
    


What do I do if it doesn't work?
--------------------------------

 1. Read the logfiles located under '~/rpi-sync/logs/'. You will most likely be looking in 
    control directory. 
 2. Only after 1. call Clemens Wager or write an Email to wagerc-dev@outlook.com 
    (I may or may not read it)


Logs are your best friend :)
